# Daliya's Notes from Git, Guthub and GitKraken: Zero to Hero  Courses

These are notes that I've made within the running the  [Git, Guthub and GitKraken: Zero to Hero  Courses](https://srse-git-github-zero2hero.netlify.app/)
and this is an example of how to make a web-page using `index.md` and Github Pages. 

Have we added  a theme to our website?
